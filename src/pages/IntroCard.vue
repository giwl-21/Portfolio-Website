          Hello, welcome to my portfolio!

          I am a computer science student at PSU who enjoys programming and science. My aspiration is to develop tools to push the boundaries of research, education, and medicine.

          I enjoy programming a lot.  When it comes to languages, I like to use JavaScript for web development/applications, Java for Object Oriented Programming, and Python for data structures and algorithms.  You can see some of my projects below.

          My goal at Penn State is to learn the very basics of technology. My enthusiasm for unifying laws has driven me to pursue a Physics minor so I can understand the world around me. Likewise, learning the fundamentals of computers will give me a strong understanding of the complex technologies of today.

          In the professional world, my goal is to come into contact with as many technologies as possible. I find that I am the most creative in those kinds of environments. 

          I also like to make illustrations in my free time.  There's a gallery down below displaying my favorite pieces.  Additionally, I enjoy reading, drinking boba, staying active, and playing decade-old video games.  I hope you enjoy browsing my website!

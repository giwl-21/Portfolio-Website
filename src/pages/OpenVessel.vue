    <h2>OpenVessel</h2>

    <p>OpenVessel is a startup that implements frameworks for machine learning on CT scans.  I worked with OpenVessel for three full months to build the prototype, from early June to when college resumed in August.  In this time, I learned to implement a NodeJS environment and a React framework into a full stack web application.  Creating this foundation then allowed me to build a 3D renderer through VTK.js on top of it.  Our prototype went on to win a $5000 grant from the NittanyAi Challenge.

    Not only have I developed my skills, but also the important aspects of collaboration that drives a team to move forward.</p>

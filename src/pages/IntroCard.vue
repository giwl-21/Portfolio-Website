          Hello, welcome to my portfolio!

          I am a student at Penn State minoring in Physics and Math. I'm also a tutor and I run weekly DS/A discussions.  If you'd like to know more about my current status, see my LinkedIn.

          I enjoy programming a lot.  From web applications, to automation tools, to AI, to systems programming, I have been fortunate to work with many different fields.  You can see some of my projects below.

          My career goal is to become an expert and use my knowledge to help other software engineers.  My mission is to contribute to long-term sustainability for future generations.  
        
          I also like to make illustrations in my free time.  There's a gallery down below displaying my favorite pieces.  Additionally, I enjoy drinking boba, hiking, hanging out with friends and family, and gaming on the Switch.  I hope you enjoy browsing my website!

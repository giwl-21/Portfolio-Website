# Portfolio Website 2.0
Website to contain my portfolio.  Built in Vue in ECMAScript using Webpack, built to be mostly scroll-navigable.  

### Features:
* User-oriented design to be read through like a resume
* ECMAScript code compiled into browser JS using Webpack
* Almost entirely made of re-usable Vue components (styled with Bootstrap 4)
* Vue routing system to display project details

### Builds:

```
npm run watch
```

### Deployment:
To deploy, just transfer the html files and css files, along with the public and dist folders.

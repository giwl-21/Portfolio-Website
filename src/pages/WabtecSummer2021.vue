    <i>Summer 2021</i>
<p>
In the summer of 2021, I worked for Wabtec Corporation as a Software Intern for 10 weeks at the GE Transportation plant in Erie.  The Erie plant is dedicated to the design, manufacturing, maintenance, and modernization of locomotives.  I interned for the Independent Test Team (ITT) to work on software tools to streamline locomotive testing.  

My primary project was the development of an application to automatically run diagnostic tests for and receive data from a locomotive control system.  I also created tools to to either populate or query databases for specific purposes.  For each piece of software, I wrote extensive documentation.  I was able to use some of the tools I made to run tests assigned to the ITT.  

Apart from technical work, I developed my network and improved my communication and professional skills.  I received a great deal of career advice from several other engineers and interns.  I also participated in events hosted by Wabtec’s cultural forums.  I made many friends both from the office and the intern housing location, and did something new every weekend.  I’m very glad to have this experience, and would like to thank my team, assignment leaders, fellow interns, and Wabtec for an amazing summer.

    <h2>OpenVessel</h2>
    <i>Summer 2020</i>
<p>
    OpenVessel is a startup that implements frameworks for machine learning on CT scans.  I worked with OpenVessel's amazing team for three full months to build the prototype, from early June to when college resumed in August.  In this time, I learned to implement a NodeJS environment and a routing framework into a full stack web application.  Using this foundation, I constructed a 3D renderer for VTK files.  Our prototype went on to win a $5000 grant from the Nittany AI Challenge.

    Working on this cutting edge product was especially difficult since open source tools combining web applications and medical data formats are relatively new and weakly documented.  I found success in carving my own path by testing various libraries and building my products on an isolated environment mimicking the app's structure.

    Not only have I developed my skills, but also the important aspects of collaboration that drives a team to move forward.  I would like to give my thanks to Rishyak, Leslie, Greg, and the rest of the OpenVessel team for bringing out my best, and to Brad Zdenek for running such a great contest.</p>
